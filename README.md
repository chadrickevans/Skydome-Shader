# Skydome Shader from "Mr. Sanna Clozz"
Shadercode for the high-functioning Skydome from my project "Mr. Sanna Clozz"

![](skydome1.gif)

This shader uses a base cloud texture converted with polar coordinates. Combined with simple color mapping for sky/horizon 
and a starry night texture mapped in world-space. It's original purpose was for use in my Christmas game "Mr. Sanna Clozz" but 
I'm releasing it to the public in hopes of building my portfolio!

You will need the following to make it work:
-Clouds converted into polar coordinates
-Mountain/Background texture
-Starry Night texture
-Ground mask texture for full coverage of the bottom half of the skydome

The shader is also fully customizable. Make changes in realtime to create unique skies for your projects.
